Plotting Assignment 2 for Exploratory Data Analysis

Introduction
------------
Fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is
harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with
setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant
into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM 2.5.
This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). You can read more information about
the NEI at the EPA National Emissions Inventory web site
(http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html).
For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records how many tons of PM 2.5  were emitted
from that source over the course of the entire year. The data that you will use for this assignment are for
1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

Assignment
==========
The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what
it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10­year period 1999–2008.

Questions
